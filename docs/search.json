There is no evidence that trail usage differs among the three seasons.\nD. If we compare days with identical temperature and precipitation, and day type (that is, whether the day is a weekday or not), then there is no evidence that trail usage differs among the three seasons.\nAnswer = D\n\n\n#5\n(2 points) In the model in equation 3, provide a brief non-technical interpretation of why the estimated partial regression coefficient associated with the quadratic effect of avgtemp is negative. That is, what have we learned from the fact that βˆ &lt; 0, and why does this make sense in the context of this particular data set?\nWhile higher avgtemp initially leads to an increase in the number of trail users, there is a point in which further temperature increases result in decreased usage. This suggests that really high temperatures deter users.\n\npar(mfrow = c(1, 2)) \nplot(reduced_model)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nquadratic_model &lt;- lm(volume ~ avgtemp + I(avgtemp^2) + precip + dayType, data = trailuser)\nsummary(quadratic_model)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = volume ~ avgtemp + I(avgtemp^2) + precip + dayType, \n    data = trailuser)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-246.463  -43.313    7.456   47.170  209.489 \n\nCoefficients:\n                 Estimate Std.
